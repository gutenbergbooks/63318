<p class="dropcap">They who by Experiments
have most diligently enquired
into the Origin of
Bodies, and their peculiar
Powers and Properties,
are the only Men who have discovered
sure Methods of acquiring a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
true Knowledge of these Things:
And whenever the Lovers of natural
Knowledge enumerate the Instruments
of this Science, they universally
agree that Chemistry has done
the greatest Service, in most industriously
promoting such Discoveries:
And when they come carefully to
examine the most celebrated Writers
in this Art, they plainly perceive, that
the most ancient Alchemists far surpassed
the rest in their Accounts of
the Nature of Things. Of this <i>Geber</i>
is an Instance, and the Writers nearest
to him; for they are content to describe,
in the plainest manner, such
Things only as they had discovered
by their Art; to improve which was
their great Application, having no
other Design in view. And indeed
no other Men whatever have so strictly
and obstinately labour’d in the Search
after natural Things, or have taken
such great Pains to turn Matter, thro’
all the various Modes of Enquiry, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the Alchemists. This is what will
be readily granted by all those who
read the Hermetic Writers, when they
openly relate common Discoveries:
But, on the contrary, when these Writers
treat of the Grand <i>Arcanum</i> (or
Secret of the Wise) they are accused
of making a bad Use of their Knowledge,
out of a Desire to conceal it,
as if they intended, on that Occasion,
not to be understood. They are said
to deal in Paradoxes, to write in a
strange manner, perfectly foreign to
all that is known, and their Style is
swell’d with hyperbolical and sublime
Expressions; which makes them be
exploded as Men out of their Senses,
fabulous, false, and Liars: For whilst
they affect to write in the gravest
Terms, and are rich in Promises,
they so cover the Thing they are
treating of in Obscurity and Darkness,
that they seem unwilling the
Secret should be reveal’d. And on
this account it is, that very many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
wise Men are of Opinion, that what
the Alchemists promise, is a Thing
impossible both to Nature and Art,
and therefore count them unworthy
the Perusal of Philosophers, as well
as undeserving of the Name. But it
is a Maxim, That it is safer to credit
an Artist in his own Art, than one
that is an utter Stranger to it; and
consequently it is rash to condemn
what the Alchemists have defined to
be possible; especially, since these
Chemists openly declare, that their
Writings are to be weighed in the
Balance of the most certain Laws
of Nature, which have been discovered
with the greatest Evidence by
the Events of Things; (that is, by
exact and repeated Experiments) and
they desire not to be credited, whenever
they produce any Thing contrary
to the Powers of Nature truly
known by Experiments. Moreover
they alledge, that they express themselves
in such an obscure manner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
only to keep profane Persons away
from their Mysteries, which are unfolded
to such as are initiated in
them; and so that it was necessary
that Things strange, obscure, and
often false, should be mixed and interpolated
with what is sincere, clear,
and true in their Writings.</p>

<p>For my part, upon looking into
chemical Matters, and perusing the
Writings of the Alchemists, I have
found them all of the same Mind
and Meaning as to the following
Particulars: That Metals are naturally
generated in their Veins, are
nourished, grow, and multiply like
other natural Things, each in their
proper Place: That the Aliments or
Nourishment of Metals, which before
are of a foreign Nature to them, are,
by the genital Power of the Metallic
Seed, converted into a truly Metallic
Nature; so that by this seminal Power
alone they lose their former, and receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
a new Property by the sole cherishing
of the pregnant Warmth; for
they will have all these Things to be
effected entirely by the same Means:
That as the Seeds of Animals and
Plants change the Aliments they receive
into their own Nourishment,
so the vivificating Seed of growing
Gold, having got a proper Food, in
a fit Matrix, by the Help of a suitable
and convenient Heat, digests the
same into its own particular Nature:
Therefore by that Means, according
to a Law prescribed to subterraneous
Things, they determine that true
Gold is always produced by Length
of Time out of a Matter of a different
Nature from Gold: For having
subdued its Aliment by its own Force,
it grows, by vital Increase, into a
Matter like to it, so long as those
four Conditions that are absolutely
required attend it. Upon pursuing
their Researches into Nature
with more Accuracy, they discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
that the Metals which are
produced, and especially Gold, are
very closely confined within a very
solid and pure Stone, which is on
every Side so very carefully closed up,
that no Passage leading to or from
the Metal can be discerned. The
Matrix of the growing Metal is thick,
hard, impenetrable, without Mixture,
closed up on all Parts, and resembles
Glass. There is nothing more hard
to understand, than to discern the
Manner how the solid Substance of
the Metal could penetrate or force itself
thro’ the ponderous Mass of the
hard Stone, into the Veins that are
found pregnant with Metal and loaded
with it. Nor is it less difficult
to conceive by what Way the same
Metal secretly passes into those concealed
Places, if it was liquid in its
first Origin, as it is highly probable
that it was. And thus the genuine
Matrix of Metal is known; the Heat
of the Metallic Mines is also known:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
It seldom equals the Warmth of a
Man in Health, but often sinks below
the 66ᵗʰ Degree in the Scale of
<i>Farenheitius</i>’s Thermometer. Hence
they who are versed in these Mysteries
direct, That the breeding Matter
of the <i>Arcanum</i> should be inclosed
in a pure Glass Vessel, and cherish’d
with a <i>Majal Heat</i>; which we find,
by Experience, to be of 50 Degrees.
And this has been found out to be at
a Medium throughout the Year, by
the most exact Observations; which
we owe to the industrious Care of
<i>Cruquius</i>. The Food of the Metal
remains yet more obscure as to what
is that seminal, proliferous and genital
Matter. Most of these Philosophers
say, That Quicksilver is the
common Matter of all Metals: That
this being changed by the Power of
the vital Seed, gives a Metal which
is defined or determined according
to the peculiar Property of the seminal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Efficacy: That every Metal, when
the Quicksilver and this Metallific
Power (which they call Sulphur) are
maturely and, as it were, thoroughly
boil’d and concocted, is brought to a
perfect Species of each such Metal.
And from hence, That every Metal
is again resolved into these two Principles,
Mercury and Sulphur. But
that there is an original Flaw or Blemish
inherent in Quicksilver from its
first Production, that wonderfully
grows up with it, and is intimately
concreted to it, and therefore not
without the greatest Difficulty to be
separated from it; and consequently
the Quicksilver wou’d not be very
simple, nor free, but is by that strange
Matter inherent in it, of a definite
Nature, and therefore wou’d hardly
suffer itself to be obsequious to the
particular Virtue of the Metallic Seed,
and be drawn into the single Nature
of one Metal: But if by a most difficult
Art, the Quicksilver be thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
purged of that foreign Blemish
or Foulness, then it would become
liquid, metallic, most weighty,
and most simple; neither by any
Art or Nature divisible into different
Things; and in which the vivified
Seed of every dissolved Metal wou’d
most perfectly multiply itself; in
which the Gold itself dissolving, being
cherish’d and maturated, wou’d
be the last so much sought for, and
so much celebrated Reward of the
Labour.</p>

<p>When I found that the chief Persons
of the Art agreed in these Principles
for a long Time, I have endeavour’d
to learn by Experience, by
what Artifice a pure unmix’d Mercury
might be obtained? Whether it
cou’d be extracted out of Metals?
What is that other Part of the Metal
that is apt to force under its Yoak the
free Quicksilver, or Mercury? I am
glad to give an Account of what I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
have discovered; not that I pretend
to teach the Art, which I am as far
from as any one; but I will faithfully
relate some laborious Experiments,
and which are so very certain, that
they may justly pass for true. Others
will not need to repeat them, but
may safely make use of these as true
upon Occasion. And a diligent Artist,
by assuming (or supposing) these
Experiments, may apply his Mind
farther to others, in order to promote
the Study of Chemistry the more. It
were to be wish’d, that every Man
directed his private Labours to the
public Good. Let the first Experiment
be this:</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Experiment_I"><span class="smcap">Experiment I.</span></h2>

<p class="hanging"><i>Pure Quicksilver contain’d in a dry
Glass Vessel that is very clean,
being agitated only by a mechanical
Shaking or Concussion, gives a soft,
black, and very fine Powder.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<h3><i>The Operation.</i></h3>

<p>Having bought 16 Ounces of
Quicksilver of the Company at <i>Amsterdam</i>,
I strain’d it thro’ a Leather
Bag; there remain’d no Dregs: I
pounded it a long while with fair
Water: The Quicksilver remained
pure after pounding: It was then a
long time pounded with Sea-Salt,
but the Colour of the Salt was not
fouled: after having poured Water to
this Salt, and to the Mercury, the
pounding was repeated; but neither
did this change the Colour. In all
this Work there appeared nothing
black, nothing foreign or foul. Then
the Quicksilver was washed and dried,
and was bright. I poured it into a
clean dry Glass Bottle, made of the
dark-green <i>German</i> Glass. At the
same Time I plac’d it in a Sand Furnace,
with a Fire that almost made
the Mercury rise; and to be sure that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
all the Water was forced out, which
is often secretly present in the Mercury,
I kept it thus for three Days:
Then having thrust a clean dry strong
Cork into the Mouth of the Vessel
whilst it was yet warm, I fasten’d it
up as close as possible. The Head
of the Bottle thus closed with a Cork,
I dipt into a liquid Cement of Pitch,
Rosin, Tallow, and Brimstone, and
covered it over with a Linnen Cloth,
which I tied fast with Packthread.
When the Glass was thus made ready,
I put it in a small Wooden Box,
which was so fitted to the Bottle,
that it touched the Sides of it; and
the empty Spaces between the Bottle
and the Box, were well filled with
Bran. Then I put on a Cover, with
a Hole bored in the Middle, for the
Top of the Neck of the Bottle to
stand a little out. The Glass was
immoveable in the Box; and it being
thus prepared, I had it fastened
to the Hammering Block of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Fulling-Mill, which always moves Night
and Day when there is any Wind.
Being thus fixed, it was rais’d up and
let down by a perpendicular Motion,
from the 1st of <i>March</i>, 1732.
<i>N. S.</i> to the 13ᵗʰ of <i>November</i> of the
same Year.</p>

<h3><i>The Effect.</i></h3>

<p>The Bottle being opened, there
was the same Weight of Mercury,
which was covered on all Sides with
a very soft, black, copious and fine
Powder. I squeez’d it thro’ a clean
Leather Bag; the liquid and pure
Mercury pass’d thro’. The Powder
remained in the Bag of a sharp metallic
Taste, somewhat resembling
the Taste of Copper or Brass.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. Quicksilver, in itself very insipid,
by meer shaking, acquires a
metallic Taste of Copper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>2. From being very mild, it becomes
sharp and penetrating.</p>

<p>3. From a very bright Silver Colour,
it turns very black.</p>

<p>4. From a Fluid, it becomes Solid
in the Form of Powder.</p>

<p>5. It may therefore be concealed
under the Appearance of such a
Powder, and deceive the Ignorant.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Experiment_II"><span class="smcap">Experiment II.</span></h2>

<p class="hanging"><i>Quicksilver exceedingly well purified,
and treated as aforesaid (<span class="antiqua"><a href="#Experiment_I">Exper. 1.</a></span>)
gives the same Powder in much
greater Plenty.</i></p>

</div>

<h3><i>The Operation.</i></h3>

<p>I suspecting that something of a
foreign Nature to it might remain in
the Quicksilver, and be separated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
from it, by Motion, under the Form
of that Powder, I brought over all
the Mercury in a Glass Retort with a
Sand-Heat. When it was all over, I
pour’d it again into the same Retort,
and forc’d it by Fire, as before. This
Method I repeated 60 times. The
Mercury was thus distilled 61 times.
In the Bottom of the Vessel there
were five Drachms of Red Powder;
of which hereafter. But this Mercury
was very fluid and shining. I
got 2 Ounces of this Mercury to be
shaken by a Fulling-Mill in the same
Manner, and by the same Operation,
and for the same Space of Time as in
the first Operation.</p>

<h3><i>The Effect.</i></h3>

<p>The Weight was the same: There
was a Powder made, soft, black, of
a sharp metallic Taste, like Copper or
Brass, to the Quantity of 2 Drachms
and 26 Grains: So it was above an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
eighth Part; whereas of the Mercury,
as they sell it, scarce ¹⁄₁₂₈ Part
was turn’d into Powder by the same
Operations; that is, by the shaking
of the Mill.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. The Mercury, which after being
distilled 61 times, yet remained
very tasteless and insipid, acquires a
metallic Taste.</p>

<p>2. From being very mild, grows
sharp and penetrating.</p>

<p>3. From having a bright Silver
Colour, and shining like a Looking-Glass,
becomes very black.</p>

<p>4. From being more fluid than it
was naturally, comes to a consistent
Powder.</p>

<p>5. Tho’ forced by a long and
strong Fire, so often repeated, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Mercury still retains this Property (of
Fluidity).</p>

<p>6. Which therefore does not depend
on any Feces or Dregs foreign
to the Mercury, and that may be
separated from it by Fire.</p>

<p>7. The Matter which, after the
Distillation of the Mercury, remain’d
in the Bottom of the Retort, red,
shining, and sharp, is no more like
the black Powder proceeding from
the Shaking, than that Part is of the
Mercury, which remained volatile.</p>

<p>8. Mercury is changed by Fire and
Shaking; by Fire into red, by Shaking
into black: Therefore Mercury
changes Colour.</p>

<p>9. Whether Mercury shaken in a
smaller Quantity, gives more of the
black? (Powder)</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Experiment_III"><span class="smcap">Experiment III.</span></h2>

<p class="hanging"><i>The very black Powder (by <span class="antiqua"><a href="#Experiment_II">Experim.
2.</a></span>) if it is forced out of a Glass
Retort by a strong Fire, returns to
pure Quicksilver.</i></p>

</div>

<h3><i>The Operation.</i></h3>

<p>The 2 Drachms and 26 Grains
of the black Powder (by <i><a href="#Experiment_II">Operat. 2.</a></i>)
I heated by a strong Fire, and forced
out of a pure Glass Retort, insomuch,
that at last the Retort was
red hot for 2 Hours.</p>

<h3><i>The Effect.</i></h3>

<p>There were in the Receiver 2
Drachms and 2 Grains of the purest
Quicksilver, insipid and shining.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
There stuck to the Sides of the
Glass, which being join’d to the Retort,
is luted to a Receiver full of
Water, a little Quicksilver here and
there, which I could not entirely
gather together. In the Bottom of
the Retort was a fix’d Spot, small,
very thin and fine, and but just
visible.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. Mercury, that has been 61
times distilled and shaken, and
turned into the afore described
Powder, returns by Fire alone into
its first Form.</p>

<p>2. Of sharp and penetrating, it
becomes very mild.</p>

<p>3. Of very black, it comes to
resemble pure Looking-Glass, with
a Silver Brightness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>4. Of a consistent Powder, it
becomes very fluid.</p>

<p>5. In these three Operations it
remains the same in itself; in the
mean time it alters its Appearance
under various Disguises.</p>

<p>6. The Taste and sharp Power
are wonderfully changed in the
Mercury, by Motion alone, by Fire
alone.</p>

<p>7. In the mean time there arises,
from these Operations, out of the
Quicksilver, a small Quantity of
fix’d Mercury.</p>

<p>8. The black (Spot) was no Dreg,
or any Thing foreign, and so separated
from the Mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scholium.</span></h3>

<p>I exposed to a Fire of 180 Degrees,
for several Months, some
Quicksilver in Glass Conic Vessels,
with flat Bottoms, that were stopt
with a chemical inverted Phial:
The Quicksilver became black, and
gave a black Powder, in all respects
alike; from which I learnt, that a
Fire in this Degree, produced the
same Effect in the Quicksilver as
the shaking.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Experiment_IV"><span class="smcap">Experiment IV.</span></h2>

<p class="hanging"><i>Quicksilver is changed by simple
Distillation.</i></p>

</div>

<h3><i>The Operation.</i></h3>

<p>18 Ounces of Quicksilver, Weight
of <i>Amsterdam</i>, I forced by a Sand-Heat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
out of a pure Glass Retort,
into the Receiver that was filled
with the purest Water, 4 Inches
high from the Bottom: This I continued
to do till there was no more
running Mercury left in the Belly
of the Vessel. I dried and cleaned
the Mercury with clean dry blotting
Paper, till it was perfectly dry, cleaned
from any Dirt that might have
fallen in, and from the Black which
in distilling is raised every time with
the Mercury as it distills: Then I
poured this Mercury into another
Retort, and forced it again as before.
This I repeated in the same
manner 52 times. In each Distillation
there was produced in the
Retort a red shining Powder.</p>

<h3><i>The Effect.</i></h3>

<p>There was then four Drams and a
half after 52 Distillations of a sharp,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
red, shining Powder, purging upwards
and downwards: There remained
16 Ounces and 5 Drachms of
Quicksilver; so 6½ Drachms were lost.
This could not be help’d. Some part
expires thro’ the Glew; something
black, with a little Quicksilver, sticks
to the Blotting-Paper every time the
Mercury is dried. This is but very
little at one time; but when the
Work comes to be often repeated,
it comes by Degrees to be a considerable
part. The Powder produced
was heavy, of a red shining Colour,
very brittle, of a very sharp, metallic
Taste, nauseous, penetrating,
hardly to be taken out of the Mouth,
disordering the Human Body very
much, and for a long time, and
disposing to Excretions. The Mercury
which had been thus treated,
appeared more fluid than common
Mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. Quicksilver thus forced by Fire,
is turned from a Fluid into Powder,
in about the ¹⁄₂₈ part of its whole
Weight.</p>

<p>2. From a Silver Brightness, like
Looking-Glass, into a shining red
Colour.</p>

<p>3. From very insipid Taste, into
one very sharp, rough, metallic, and
penetrating.</p>

<p>4. From very mild, into sharp,
virulent, venomous, disordering the
Body, and exciting Pains.</p>

<p>5. From volatile into more fixed;
which is no longer volatile by the

<p class="hanging"><i>I was desirous to know what would
happen to the Mercury, if it was
still forced by a Fire requisite to
Distillation.</i></p>

</div>

<h3><i>The Operation.</i></h3>

<p>I took care to distill, as before,
the 16 Ounces and 5 Drachms of
Mercury remaining from the former
Operation: I distill’d it so long,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
’till there remained none in the Bottom.
What was came over, being
cleaned and dried, I always poured
again into the same Retort. This
Work I repeated 448 distinct times.
Now this Mercury had been forced
by Distillation compleatly 500
times: It had risen always more
fluid and pure. The last time I
heated the Fire more, but then the
red Powder seem’d rather to be lessened
than increased, perhaps being
in part revived.</p>

<h3><i>The Effect.</i></h3>

<p>The Powder in the bottom of the
Retort, weigh’d 1 Ounce, 5 Drams,
and 21 Grains. The Mercury remaining
after 500 Distillations,
weighed 9 Ounces and 5 Drachms:
But it happen’d, in so often distilling,
that sometimes the Retorts
broke, and so some of the Mercury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
got away, besides what was lost by
so often cleaning and drying.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. The Corollaries of the second
and fourth Operations, are likewise
true in this Operation.</p>

<p>2. The Mercury is very unchangeable
in one part,</p>

<p>3. Yet continually changeable in
the other part.</p>

<p>4. Out of the altered Form,
perhaps it returns into its former
Shape.</p>

<p>5. And perhaps after Regeneration
by a new Action of Fire, it is
carried back again into the altered
Shape.</p>

</div>

<h3><i>The Operation.</i></h3>

<p>The very fluid and very pure
Mercury (out of which I had made
by 501 Distillations, 2 Ounces, 1
Drachm, and 51 Grains of Powder,
by the <a href="#Experiment_II">2ᵈ</a>, <a href="#Experiment_IV">4ᵗʰ</a>, and <a href="#Experiment_V">5ᵗʰ</a> Operations)
which remained to the Quantity of
10 Ounces, 5 Drachms, and one
half, I distilled out of a pure Glass
Retort, till the Mercury was all passed
thro’ into the Receiver. The
Bottom of the Retort was as clean
as if it had been just taken out of
the Furnace at the Glass-House: But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
at the Edge of the Surface, where
it had stood before the Distillation
in the Belly of the Retort, there was
a shining Ring, of a beautiful red,
fine and fair to the Eye. The Mercury
that came out, being purified
and dried, I poured again into the
same Retort, and forced it into the
Receiver. This was repeated ten
times: Every time more of the red
Powder was made, and in no less
Quantity then from the crude Mercury.</p>

<h3><i>The Effect.</i></h3>

<p>The Mercury very vivid and very
bright; the fix’d Powder of a beautiful
red, but (as in <a href="#Experiment_II">2ᵈ</a>, <a href="#Experiment_IV">4ᵗʰ</a>, <a href="#Experiment_V">5ᵗʰ</a> Operations)
to the Quantity of seven
Grains.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. The Mutability of Mercury into
this Powder by Fire, still remains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
in the Mercury, after an eighth part
of it has been changed into the Powder.</p>

<p>2. After 511 Distillations, each of
which had produced some of that
Powder, this Mutability remains, altho’
no new Mercury has been added.</p>

<p>3. Therefore that Powder is scarce
to be accounted the Dregs or Feces
separable by Distillation from the intimate
Substance of the Mercury.</p>

<p>4. And hence it is certain the Mercury
is so changed by this Means;
but it is not certain that it is by this
Means defecated.</p>

<p>5. Fire is not united to Mercury,
as some celebrated modern Chemists
have said it was, in their Writings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>6. Diligence can scarce teach the
constant Artists those Bounds beyond
which that Powder is no longer produced.</p>

<p>7. If that Powder is produced by
Fire out of the crude Sulphur of
Mercury, this Distillation does not
purge the Mercury from it.</p>

<h3><i>The Operation.</i></h3>

<p>Two Ounces, 1 Drachm, and 51
Grains of that Powder, I put into
a clean Glass Retort, covered with a
Coat of Clay, mix’d or temper’d
with Sand. I heated it by Degrees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
till at last the Retort, the bare Fire
being laid over it, grew almost red
with the bright Fire that covered it
in the Sand Furnace, for three Hours

<h3><i>The Effect.</i></h3>

<p>There came out 1 Ounce, and
half a Drachm of pure Mercury revived
from that Powder: There remain’d
in the Bottom of the Retort
seven Drachms and a half of the
bright red Powder. Something stuck
in the Neck of the Retort, and in
the Glass Vessel applied to the Neck
of the Retort. Perhaps some was
dissipated by so great and lasting a
Fire.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. The Mercury returns out of the
Powder into which it was turned by
the Fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>2. Being revived, it recovers all
its former Properties, and lays aside
all those that it had acquir’d. Out
of the Powder comes the same Mercury
as at first.</p>

<p>3. The acquired Fixedness does
not bear a great Fire.</p>

<p>4. Yet in that Powder one part is
more fixed than another; this still
remains a Powder, that returns to
Mercury.</p>

<h3><i>The Operation.</i></h3>

<p>Seven Drachms and 37 Grains of
that Powder in a very clean Glass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Retort, cased over with a Coat of
Sand and Clay, I put into the naked
Fire, which was carefully increased
by Degrees, ’till the little Retort,
which was entirely covered with the
Coals, grew quite red hot. In this
Degree of Heat I kept it for four
Hours.</p>

<h3><i>The Effect.</i></h3>

<p>In the Receiver was seven Drams
of most pure Mercury reviv’d from
this Powder. In the Bottom of the
Retort were 15 Grains of a dark,
subtle, and fixed Powder, in so
strong and lasting a Fire. There was
a broad Spot, very thin, of a beautiful
red, impressed on the Bottom
of the Retort, and, as it were, penetrating
into the Glass.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. Mercury by Fire alone is changed
into the Powder above describ’d.
(<a href="#Experiment_II">2</a>, <a href="#Experiment_IV">4</a>,
<a href="#Experiment_V">5</a>, <a href="#Experiment_VI">6</a>,

<p>2. This Powder, by Fire alone,
but a stronger, is changed into Mercury.</p>

<p>3. Thus the Serpent that has bitten
itself dies.</p>

<p>4. It arises again more glorious
from Death.</p>

<p>5. So much Labour, and so great
Fire being so long sustain’d, out of
17 Ounces of Mercury, only 15
Grains remain’d fix’d in the Glass,
which was so hot, that it was ready
to melt.</p>

<p>6. Silver, Gold, and other Metals
fought for by this Art out of Quicksilver,
is scarce any, in Proportion to
the Charge and Labour.</p>

<p>7. Of the Powder so fix’d from
Mercury, only the 72ᵈ Part remains
fix’d in this Fire, the rest returns to
Mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>8. Twenty-two Grains were lost.
Were they dispers’d? or was this
Quantity of Weight first accreted
to the Mercury by Fire, thence again
separated by a stronger Fire?</p>

<p>9. The Nature of Mercury is constant,
simple, and cannot be separated
into dissimilar Parts by Distillation;
not into fix’d and volatile;
not into pure and impure; not into
feces and defecated; not into different
Elements.</p>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. Quicksilver persists in the Fire,
retaining its Nature unalterable.</p>

<p>2. Simple, and not separable, into
different Parts by Distillation.</p>

<p>3. It is fixed by Fire, and seems
changed in its outward Form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>4. Appearing so, in various Parts,
it acquires different Degrees of Fixedness.</p>

<p>5. Yet none of these Parts acquired,
by so strong and lasting a
Fire, the Fixedness of Gold or Silver.</p>

<p>6. The fixating Cause is Fire passing
thro’ the Glass; thus changing
part of the Mercury, either by its
simple Action, or by its uniting itself
with the Quicksilver.</p>

<p>7. The Fire so acting, by 511
Distillations, by its Action or Conjunction,
could not yet change the
smallest Particle of the Mercury into
Gold or Silver.</p>

<p>8. But from the Mercury so fixed
by Fire, a greater Fire restores true
Mercury; or the known Power of
Lead makes it vanish out of the Cupell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>9. Therefore it does not appear,
by these Experiments, that from Mercury
and Fire so conspiring, any
known Metal is produced. Those
13 Grains did not run by a Wind-Furnace;
they did not persist in
the Lead; they were not dissolved
with the Mercury into an Amalgama.</p>

<p>10. Therefore Fire, by these Experiments,
is not demonstrated to be
the Sulphur of the Philosophers that
fixes Mercury into Metals.</p>

<p>11. But it seems probable that the
Sulphur of the Philosophers is something
else very near it.</p>

<p>12. The fixed part is not the Feces
of Mercury, nor its crude generating
Sulphur; it returns into Mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>13. The Depuration of Mercury
from the earthy Feces, and the watry
Crudeness, seems scarcely to be
obtained so easily by Distillation
alone; perhaps by some more secret
Work it is obtain’d.</p>

<p>14. To make Gold or Silver of
Mercury, does not proceed. Ignorant
Men are given up to Imagination,
easy to Promises, rich in Hope.
This Mercury remained Mercury.</p>

<p>15. Safe from the fallacious Writings
and Prescriptions of the Philosophers,
who promise such Things in
a short Time, or a few Months from
Mercury and Fire: Indeed, within
the Space of many Years, I have not
discovered the least Marks of a first
beginning.</p>

<p>I pour’d a Drachm of Mercury
twice distilled into a Glass Urinal,
which I fill’d with Rain Water:
Then I set the Vessel upon the naked
Fire: The Water boil’d strongly for
eight Hours, yet so that there still
was some Water swimming over the
Mercury. The Mercury being afterwards
weigh’d, gave a Drachm
without any Loss.</p>

<p>Again; I pour’d a Drachm of
Mercury into a clean dry Glass Vessel.
This I so fitted in a Kettle,
that it cou’d not fall aside. I filled
the Kettle with Water; I made the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Water boil eight Hours. This Vessel
was cylindrical, open, two Inches
and one half deep, and placed so
that the Water cou’d not get in.
After this was so done, the Mercury
weighed one Drachm without any
Loss.</p>

<p>I put pure Mercury into a Glass
Vessel, I poured Water upon it; and
setting the Still over it, I boil’d it for
a long while: No Mercury ascended.
I continued boiling, till all
the Water being gone out, the Mercury
remained dry in the Bottom of
the Vessel. However, I did not then
increase the Fire; but the Mercury
presently ascended to the Sides of the
Vessel, and into the Head. The
Reason of this appears from what I
have written in my chemical Institutions
about Water and Fire.</p>

that it shall ascend from the Bottom

<h3><i>The Operation.</i></h3>

<p>Having made a Mass of a Pound
and a half of Mercury, with half a
Pound of Lead (the Chemists call
such a Mass an Amalgama) I shook
it in a Glass Vessel. There was produced
a very black Powder. This
I put into a Glass Cucurbite 14 Inches
high; I pour’d pure distill’d
Wine-Vinegar over it. By a gentle
Distillation I took away the Phlegm.
I then increased the Heat a little,
but so that the Liquor did not boil.
The Mercury ascended into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Head, together with the Phlegm,
and thence into the Receiver. The
same I tried and experienced other
Ways. It is a Circumstance worthy
a Chemist’s Speculation; but I shall
say no more of it here. By much
the like Artifice, I have seen Quicksilver
made so volatile, that it was
rais’d in my Digestory-Furnace with
a less Degree of Heat, than that of a
Man in Health, and ascended to the
Sides of the Vessel. Do you think
the Mercury was then purer? It was
mix’d with Metal, and very dry.
But perhaps I may some other time
relate some very laborious Experiments
which I have made for several
Years, in examining Mercury and
Metals, if I find that such Things
are likely to meet with the Approbation
of the Learned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Experiment_XV"><span class="smcap">Experiment XV.</span></h2>

<p class="hanging"><i><span class="antiqua">Geber</span> has written, that pure Mercury
is heavier than Gold: For a
long time I endeavour’d to learn,
Whether Mercury could be brought
to a denser, and consequently a
heavier State, than that it is naturally
in? I began to attempt
this by a Separation of the lighter
and more changeable Part, from
the more heavy Remainder, but
cou’d not do it. I afterwards strove
to defecate it by various Methods:
It did not succeed. However, I
discovered some Things that deserve
the Contemplation of curious Observers,
which I beg leave to mention,
as follows: Two Ounces of pure
Gold in a Mass, by hydrostatical
Examination, in Rain-Water, defecated
by gentle Distillation, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
found to weigh in proportion to
Water, as 19¹¹⁹⁄₅₀₀ to 1. Common
Mercury, as sold, once distilled
from the Retort to the same Water,
weighs as 13⁵⁷⁄₁₀₀ to 1. Mercury
amalgamated with purest Gold, and
then distilled some hundred times,
as 13⁵⁵⁄₁₀₀ to 1. Mercury so treated
with the purest Silver, was to Water
as 13⁵⁷⁄₁₀₀ to 1. Mercury united
with Lead, and with it all turn’d
into Powder, and thence resuscitated
by a strong Fire, was to Water,
as 13⁵⁸⁄₁₀₀ to 1. Mercury 511
times distilled, was as 14¹¹⁄₁₀₀ to 1.</i></p>

</div>

<p>These Statical Weighings were
made by Instruments that cou’d not
be found fault with, and with the
most prudent Care. I spent some
Years to prepare Mercury for this Purpose;
and, for ought I know, no
one else has had any Regard to it.
Afterwards, many Things proper for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Meditation may be drawn from
thence, by proper Judges in this
Matter: But I may be allowed to
make a few Observations.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corollaries.</span></h3>

<p>1. If Mercury, when defecated,
becomes lighter, then it is rendred
most defecated by Gold and Lead.
By the Art of <i>Suchtenius</i> and <i>Philalethes</i>,
it remains the same.</p>

<p>2. If Mercury, when defecated,
becomes heavier, then it is rendred
most defecated by Silver, in proportion
to other Metals; but most of
all by simple Distillation, by a Conversion
into a Red Præcipitate of
itself, and a Resuscitation thence
made.</p>

<p>3. Mercury may be made thicker
(condensated) by Silver and Fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>4. Mercury may be thickned by
Distillation by Fire most of all. Is
this then the best Way to depurate
and perfect it?</p>

<p>5. Does Mercury deposite its heaviest
Part in Gold? Is this deposited
Matter the Seed of Gold?</p>

<p>6. Does Mercury deposite its heaviest
Part in Lead? Is this deposited
Matter the Seed of Gold?</p>

<p>7. Does Fire, boiling the Mercury
511 times, fixing and resuscitating
it, increase that heaviest Part? Can
Mercury, by a continued Work, at
length be thickned into the Weight
of Gold? Would it then be live Gold,
or the Mercury of the Philosophers?
This let proper Judges examine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>Let these few Remarks, and yet
not made without Trouble and Caution,
concerning the Purification of
Quicksilver, suffice at this time. I
have some by me much more operose
concerning the extracting of
Mercury out of Metals, of its Action
upon Metals, of Metals themselves;
perhaps, when I have Leisure, I may
offer them to the Public, that Persons,
after being warned, may spare
a fruitless Labour and Expence.
